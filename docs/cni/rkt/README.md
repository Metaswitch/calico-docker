# Calico Networking with rkt

This tutorial describes how to set up a Calico cluster in a mixed Docker and rkt environment.
Docker is used for running the Calico components but workloads are run under rkt.

## 1. Environment setup

This tutorial walks through getting a cluster set up with Vagrant. 

### 1.1 Install dependencies

* [VirtualBox][virtualbox] 5.0.0 or greater.
* [Vagrant][vagrant] 1.7.4 or greater.
* [Git][git]

<!--- master only -->
### 1.2 Clone this project

    git clone https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-containers.git
<!--- else
### 1.2 Clone this project, and checkout the **release** release

    git clone https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-containers.git
    git checkout tags/**release**
<!--- end of master only -->
    
### 1.3 Startup and SSH
Change into the directory for this guide:
  
    cd calico-containers/docs/cni/rkt

Run

    vagrant up

To connect to your servers
* Linux/Mac OS X
    * run `vagrant ssh <hostname>`
* Windows
    * Follow instructions from https://github.com/nickryand/vagrant-multi-putty
    * run `vagrant putty <hostname>`

### 1.4 Verify environment

You should now have two CoreOS servers. The servers are named calico-01 and calico-02 
and have IP addresses 172.18.18.101 and 172.18.18.102.

At this point, it's worth checking that your servers can ping each other.

From calico-01

    ping 172.18.18.102

From calico-02

    ping 172.18.18.101

If you see ping failures, the likely culprit is a problem with the VirtualBox network between the VMs.  You should 
check that each host is connected to the same virtual network adapter in VirtualBox and rebooting the host may also 
help.  Remember to shut down the VMs with `vagrant halt` before you reboot.

You should also verify each host can access etcd.  The following will return an error if etcd is not available.

    curl -L http://localhost:2379/version

And finally check that Docker is running on both hosts by running

    docker ps


## 2. Starting Calico services

Once you have your cluster up and running, start calico on all the nodes

On calico-01

    sudo calicoctl node

On calico-02

    sudo calicoctl node

This will start a container on each host. Check they are running

    docker ps

You should see output like this on each node

    vagrant@calico-01:~$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    ffe6cb403e9b        calico/node:latest              "/sbin/my_init"          21 seconds ago      Up 20 seconds                           calico-node

## 3. Create the networks

You can configure multiple networks when using rkt and each network is represented by a configuration file in 
/etc/rkt/net.d/. Connections to a given container are only allowed from containers on the same network. 
Containers on multiple networks can be accessed by containers on each network that it is connected to.

To define a rkt network for Calico, create a configuration file in /etc/rkt/net.d/.
- Each network should be given a unique "name"
- To use Calico networking, specify "type": "calico"
- To use Calico IPAM, specify "type": "calico-ipam" in the "ipam" section.

This worked example creates two rkt networks. Run these commands on both `calico-01` and `calico-02`
```
cat >/etc/rkt/net.d/10-calico-net1.conf <<EOF
{
    "name": "net1",
    "type": "calico",
    "ipam": {
        "type": "calico-ipam"
    }
}
EOF

cat >/etc/rkt/net.d/10-calico-net2.conf <<EOF
{
    "name": "net2",
    "type": "calico",
    "ipam": {
        "type": "calico-ipam"
    }
}
EOF
```


## 4. Create a webserver on one of the networks

With the networks created, let's start a container on `calico-01`

### On calico-01
Create a webserver using an `nginx` container. We'll put this on `net1` network.

Because `rkt` doesn't support daemonizing containers directly, we'll use [systemd-run][systemd-run]
to create a transient systemd service.

    sudo systemd-run rkt run --store-only=true --insecure-options=image --net=net1 --mount volume=myvol,target=/var/run --volume=myvol,kind=empty docker://nginx
 
 This will produce output like

    Running as unit run-16961.service.
    
 Normal [systemd commands][systemd-run] can then be used to get the status of the container and view its logs. 
 
 We can then use `rkt list` to show the IP address
  
    $ sudo rkt list
	UUID            APP     IMAGE NAME                                      STATE   NETWORKS
	592b9eec        nginx   registry-1.docker.io/library/nginx:latest       running net1:ip4=192.168.0.0, default-restricted:ip4=172.16.28.2

 
 So we can see that we now have an `nginx` container running on the network `net1` with an IP address of `192.168.0.0`
 rkt also creates a second network called `default-restricted`. This is used for communication with the rkt metadata service running on the host and is covered in the [rkt documentation](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/networking.md#the-default-restricted-network)
 
## 5. Validate access to webserver

Now that we've created a webserver and we know it's IP address, we can access it using `wget` from containers running on 
either host, as long as they are created on the same network.

On calico-02 use wget to access the nginx webserver

    sudo rkt run --net=net1 --store-only=true --insecure-options=image docker://busybox --exec=/bin/wget -- -T 1 -q -O - 192.168.0.0 2>/dev/null

Expected output

    [ 1808.316525] wget[4]: <!DOCTYPE html>
    [ 1808.316988] wget[4]: <html>
    [ 1808.317384] wget[4]: <head>
    [ 1808.317723] wget[4]: <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
    [ 1808.318226] wget[4]: <style>
    [ 1808.318592] wget[4]: body {
    [ 1808.318958] wget[4]: width: 35em;
    [ 1808.319457] wget[4]: margin: 0 auto;
    [ 1808.319833] wget[4]: font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    [ 1808.320416] wget[4]: }
    [ 1808.320793] wget[4]: </style>
    [ 1808.321261] wget[4]: </head>
    [ 1808.321655] wget[4]: <body>
    [ 1808.322086] wget[4]: <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    [ 1808.322549] wget[4]: <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
    [ 1808.322918] wget[4]: working. Further configuration is required.</p>
    [ 1808.323476] wget[4]: <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
    [ 1808.323855] wget[4]: <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
    [ 1808.334445] wget[4]: Commercial support is available at
    [ 1808.335309] wget[4]: <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>
    [ 1808.335545] wget[4]: <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
    [ 1808.335777] wget[4]: </body>
    [ 1808.336030] wget[4]: </html>

    

This command runs the `wget` command in a busybox container, telling `wget` to be quiet, to only wait a second for a response and to output to stdout. 
Stderr is redirected to /dev/null as we're not interested in the logs from `rkt` for this command.

You can repeat this command on calico-01 and check that access works the same from any server in your cluster.

### 5.1 Checking cluster isolation 
If you repeat the above command but place the container on network `net2` then the `nginx` server can no longer be reached.

    sudo rkt run --net=net2 --insecure-options=image docker://busybox --exec=/bin/wget -- -T 1 -q -O - 192.168.0.0 2>/dev/null 
    [ 1856.858027] wget[4]: wget: download timed out
