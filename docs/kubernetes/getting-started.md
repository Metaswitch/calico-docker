# Deploying Calico on Kubernetes
The easiest way to get started with Calico on Kubernetes is by following the [Calico-Kubernetes vagrant demo](vagrant.md).

In addition to the vagrant demo, we also have guides for:
- [Bare-metal on Ubuntu 15.04](// TODO - link to kubernetes demo)
- [Bare-metal on CoreOS](kube-bare-metal-coreos.md)

We’ll be publishing guides for more OSs, but in the meantime, if you need assistance don’t hesitate to contact us directly.
